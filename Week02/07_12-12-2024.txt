Cascading:

Determines how styles are applied when multiple rules target the same element.
Order: Inline styles > IDs > Classes > Elements.
Specificity:

When two div elements have the same color, the rule with higher specificity will be applied.
Inline styles > IDs > Classes > Element selectors.
Inheritance:

Some properties are naturally inherited, like text-related properties (color, font-family).
Keywords:
inherit: Forces inheritance from the parent element.
initial: Resets to the default value defined by CSS.
unset: Acts as inherit for inherited properties and initial otherwise.
!important:

Overrides all other rules, regardless of specificity.
Should be used sparingly for debugging or critical overrides.
Overflow:

Controls content overflow:
hidden: Clips overflowing content.
scroll: Adds scrollbars.
visible: Default, content spills outside.
Object-Fit (for images/videos):

Defines how media fits in its container.
cover: Maintains aspect ratio, fills container, might crop.
contain: Fits entirely within the container.
fill: Stretches to fill, might distort.
Debugging CSS:

Use browser Inspect tools to view and modify styles in real time.
Form Task:

Create a simple form with fields, buttons, and apply styling.
Test and debug using the concepts above.
