    <div class="about_html_css">
        <p>HTML is used to structure the content on a web page. It defines different elements like paragraphs, images, links, tables, headings, and forms. HTML acts like the skeleton of a webpage, providing the structure that the content is built upon.

            Key Features of HTML:
            
            Provides structure to the content of a webpage.
            Organizes content into sections like headings, paragraphs, and images.
            Allows the creation of links and navigation for the webpage.
            Facilitates user input through forms. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. While HTML is used to structure content on a web page, CSS is used to control how that content is displayed, including aspects like colors, fonts, layout, and overall design. CSS allows web developers to create visually appealing and consistent designs across web pages.</p>
